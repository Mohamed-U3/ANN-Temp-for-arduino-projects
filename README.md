# ANN-Temp-for-arduino-projects
this is a template I made that has a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) AKA (it's type of neural network is a basic feed-forward network with backpropagation for training), this template has a variable that can change its value to make a change the Neural counts for the input, output, or hidden layers to match the required application
